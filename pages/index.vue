                I am the founder of VoidZero, a company building the next generation toolchain for JavaScript and
                TypeScript. I am currently based in Singapore working with a globally remote team.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg font-thin leading-8">Before founding VoidZero, I had been working as an independent open
                source developer since 2016. I am the creator of the JavaScript framework Vue.js and the frontend build
                tool Vite. Most of my work is open source and publicly available on GitHub. If you happen to benefit
                from my OSS work, you can support me financially via GitHub Sponsors.</p>
            <p class="text-lg font-thin leading-8">You can follow me on X and Bluesky where I mostly post about Vue and
                frontend technologies. If you happen to speak Chinese, my Chinese name is 尤雨溪 (yóu yǔ xī) and I have a
                Chinese-only X alt for non-tech-focused musings.</p>
            <p class="text-lg font-thin leading-8">Outside of programming and helping my wife take care of our two kids,
                I enjoy video games (soulsborne & roguelikes are my favorite), karaoke, Japanese food, playing
                badminton, watching UFC/NBA/F1, and collecting watches.</p>
